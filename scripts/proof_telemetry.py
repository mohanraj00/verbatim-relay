"""Proof of the full telemetry with one app (issue #26). Local only.

The app is the full toy shop (examples/toy-shop-full/): an Agent SDK session with 3 tools, a stock
service over HTTP, and a direct call to a case-note model with the OpenAI Chat Completions API. The
proof runs the stock service and the toy note model on local ports. The Agent SDK session uses the
real Anthropic API through the model API proxy.

The app has a planted bug that only the backend calls show: after 1 `reserve` tool call, the app
reserves the items 2 times, because its retry loop has no break. The model tells the customer the
number that it asked for. The tester asks for 1 teapot set in turn 2. Then the tester types
`nookku end`, and the harness model evaluates the test with no other prompt.

T1  Each turn has items from 3 sources: the session file of the Agent SDK, the backend proxy and
    the model API proxy.
T2  report.md has a row for turn 2 that cites the trace lines of all the `POST /reserve` calls of
    turn 2. A row that cites only 1 call does not show that the app reserved 2 times.
P5  report.md holds a reservation id from the records, or an exact quote of 20 or more characters
    from a reply of the agent.
P7  After the evaluation, `nookku verify` finds the test folder intact.

The isolation, the evaluation and the check of model answers against instruction files are the
same as in scripts/proof_report.py.

       or hooks-codex)
