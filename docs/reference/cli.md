# CLI reference

This page lists each command of `nookku`, each flag and each exit code. The parser is in [src/nookku/cli.py](../../src/nookku/cli.py). The test `tests/test_docs.py` checks that each command and each flag of the parser is on this page. It also checks that each flag on this page is in the parser.

```text
nookku [-h] [--version] COMMAND ...
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--version` | Print the version and exit with 0. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print the help of the program or of a command, and exit with 0. |

Each command that takes `--root` uses the current folder by default. The root is the project: the folder that holds `.nookku/`.

An unknown command or flag prints the usage and exits with 2. With no command, `nookku` prints the help and exits with 2.

## Commands of a test

### `nookku start`

Start a test: run the entry through the tap and switch relay mode on ([SPEC.md section 7.2](../../SPEC.md#72-start-and-end)). It needs an `entry` in `.nookku/config.json`.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--json` | off | Print `current.json` of the test as JSON, or `{"error": ...}`. |
| `--tester-session ID` | none | The tester's harness session id. The bridge never takes this session as a session of the app. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The test started. |
| 1 | The test did not start: no entry, an invalid configuration (for example an unknown key), a test that runs already, or an entry that exited. The text names the cause. |

### `nookku end`

End the test: switch relay mode off, stop the entry and collect its sessions, the trace, the audit and the seal ([SPEC.md section 7.2](../../SPEC.md#72-start-and-end)). If no test runs, it switches relay mode off.

`end` in a shell gives no evaluation. If the test needs an evaluation, it prints the prompt to type in the harness: `To evaluate the test, type this prompt in your harness: nookku end` ([SPEC.md section 9.1](../../SPEC.md#91-start)).

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--json` | off | Print the manifest of the test as JSON, or `null` if no test ran. |
| `--evaluation` | off | Print one JSON object: `text`, the end text, and `evaluation`, the evaluation prompt or `null` ([SPEC.md section 9.1](../../SPEC.md#91-start)). The plugin uses it. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Always. |

### `nookku status`

Show relay mode and the running test.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--json` | off | Print `{"on": ..., "test": ..., "text": ..., "attachments": ...}`. `text` is the status line of the plugin. `attachments` is the text that refuses a prompt with an attachment in the plugin. Each is `null` if relay mode is off. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Always. |

### `nookku check`

Run a short test with one message, and check the entry and its model sessions ([SPEC.md section 7.1](../../SPEC.md#71-configuration)). The message is always `Hello from nookku check. What can you help me with?`

PASS proves the connection, not the reply. PASS means that:

- the entry sent a reply line, not an `error` line;
- the audit of the test exits with 0;
- the test found a model session and its session file for each harness in `models`.

`check` does not judge the text of the reply. A fallback reply of the app also passes. [how-to/connect-your-agent.md](../how-to/connect-your-agent.md#make-sure-that-check-runs-your-real-app) shows how to make sure that the entry runs your real app.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--json` | off | Print `{"pass": ..., "report": [...]}`. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The entry sent a reply, the audit of the test is clean, and the test found a model session for each harness in `models`. |
| 1 | The check failed, or the test did not start. For example, the audit of the test exits with 1 or 2, the test wrote no valid `audit.json`, or a model session has no session file. |

### `nookku mode`

```text
nookku mode [STATE] [--root PATH] [--tester-session ID]
```

Switch relay mode on or off. With an entry, `on` starts a test and `off` ends it. With no entry, it only switches relay mode ([how-to/http-tap.md](../how-to/http-tap.md)). Before it switches relay mode on, it reads `config.json`, if the file exists. If the file is broken, `on` shows the error and does not switch relay mode on ([#109](https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku/pull/109)). If the file does not exist, `on` tells you to run `nookku init plugin`, and relay mode stays off. The `/nookku` command of the plugin runs `nookku mode` with its words, and shows the output.

| Argument or flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `STATE` | `status` | `on`, `off` or `status`. `start` is the same as `on`, and `end` is the same as `off`. |
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--tester-session ID` | none | The tester's harness session id. With an entry, the test copies this session when it ends. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Always. If a test does not start, the text names the cause. |

## Commands that read a test

### `nookku view`

Print each relayed turn. Both forms of the relay use it to show each reply in a second terminal. With an entry, it shows the turns of the latest test, and it follows to the next test.

If the relay record has an invalid line, `view` shows the error with the file and the line on stderr. Without `--no-follow`, it shows the error one time and continues to wait. When the record changes and is valid, it shows the next turns. With `--no-follow`, it stops with exit code 2. A test has no relay record before its first turn, so the view of such a test shows no turn and exits with 0. After the end of a test, `nookku verify` shows a record that is missing.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--no-follow` | off | Print the turns so far and stop. Without it, `view` waits for new turns until you stop it. |
| `--record FILE` | from the config | The relay record to show. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The view stopped. |
| 2 | The config cannot be read. With `--no-follow`: the relay record is invalid, or, with no entry, the configured record does not exist. |

### `nookku transcript`

Print the exact conversation for the model to evaluate ([SPEC.md section 5](../../SPEC.md#5-relays)). With an entry, the scope is the latest test.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--test ID` | the latest test | The test to print. |
| `--trace` | off | Print each turn as the app got it (from `tap.jsonl`), with the model items and the findings of that turn ([SPEC.md section 9.2](../../SPEC.md#92-evaluation-prompt)). It ignores `--record`, `--all` and `--session`. |
| `--all` | off | With no entry: each session of the record, not only the latest one. |
| `--session ID` | none | Only the turns of this harness session. |
| `--record FILE` | from the config | The relay record to print. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The transcript printed. With `--trace`, also if a record is invalid: then the first line says `Record: INVALID` and the transcript shows no turn. |
| 2 | No test folder (with `--trace`), the config cannot be read, or the relay record is missing or invalid. |

### `nookku audit`

Compare the relay record with the tap record ([SPEC.md section 3](../../SPEC.md#3-audit)).

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--tap FILE` | required | The tap record. |
| `--relay FILE` | required | The relay record. |
| `--json` | off | Print the report as JSON. The bridge writes this form to `audit.json`. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The records are valid and have no break. |
| 1 | The records are valid and have one or more breaks. |
| 2 | A record is missing or invalid, or the tap has an unparsed exchange. |

### `nookku trace`

```text
nookku trace [TEST] [--root PATH] [--json]
```

Build the trace of a test again, and show its findings ([SPEC.md section 8](../../SPEC.md#8-trace)). If the test has a seal, it rebuilds only from sources that agree with the seal.

| Argument or flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TEST` | the latest test | The test id. |
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--json` | off | Print `findings.json`. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The trace was built. |
| 2 | No test folder with a manifest, or the seal is broken and the trace was not rebuilt. |

### `nookku verify`

```text
nookku verify [TEST] [--root PATH] [--json]
```

Check that no record of a test changed after its end ([SPEC.md section 7.4](../../SPEC.md#74-seal)).

| Argument or flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TEST` | the latest test | The test id. |
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--json` | off | Print the result as JSON. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The seal is intact. |
| 2 | The seal is broken, the test has no seal, or there is no test folder. |

## Commands that install or connect

### `nookku init`

```text
nookku init HARNESS [--root PATH] [--entry COMMAND] [--models LIST] [options]
```

Write the config, and the project hooks of a harness. It writes `.nookku/config.json`, the file `.nookku/mode`, and the hooks: `.codex/hooks.json` for Codex, `.claude/settings.local.json` for Claude Code. It keeps your other hooks, also a hook in the same group as a hook of nookku. With `plugin`, it writes no hooks, because the nookku plugin has them. Do not use the plugin and the project hooks in one project, or each message is sent two times.

If `config.json` exists, `init` keeps each key and changes only the keys of the flags that you give. For example, a second run keeps `backends` and `"evaluate": false`. It prints the keys that it changed and the keys that it kept. A new `config.json` gets each key. The default of a flag applies only to a new file.

If `config.json` has an unknown key, or if `config.json` or the hook file is not valid JSON, `init` writes nothing. Correct the file, then run `init` again.

| Argument or flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HARNESS` | | `codex`, `claude-code` or `plugin`. |
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. |
| `--entry COMMAND` | none | The entry command of a test, as one string. The shell rules split it into arguments. |
| `--models LIST` | none | The app's model harnesses, separated by commas: `claude-code`, `codex` or both. |
| `--tap-url URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8800/` | The config key `tap_url`. |
| `--agent-url URL` | empty | The config key `agent_url`. |
| `--adapter NAME` | `json` | The config key `adapter`. |
| `--message-field PATH` | `text` | The config key `message_field`. |
| `--reply-field PATH` | `reply` | The config key `reply_field`. |
| `--openai-model NAME` | empty | The config key `openai_model`. |
| `--openai-stream` | off | The config key `openai_stream`: set it to `true`. |
| `--record FILE` | `.nookku/relay.jsonl` | The config key `record`. |

[config.md](config.md#nookkuconfigjson) explains each key.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The files were written. |
| 1 | Nothing was written: `config.json` or the hook file cannot be read, or `config.json` has an unknown key. The text names the cause. |

### `nookku setup`

Print the guide that connects a test to the app ([setup.md](../../src/nookku/setup.md)). A harness model reads it and writes the entry ([how-to/connect-your-agent.md](../how-to/connect-your-agent.md)).

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Always. |

### `nookku tap`

```text
nookku tap (--agent URL | --cmd -- COMMAND...) --record FILE [options]
```

Run the tap proxy in front of the agent ([SPEC.md section 4](../../SPEC.md#4-tap)). A test starts it for you, so you need this command only for an agent that is an HTTP server ([how-to/http-tap.md](../how-to/http-tap.md)).

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--agent URL` | none | HTTP mode: the agent's base URL. |
| `--cmd` | off | Stdio mode: start the command after `--` as the agent. |
| `--record FILE` | required | The tap record (JSONL). The tap adds rows to it. |
| `--listen HOST:PORT` | `127.0.0.1:8800` | The address of the tap. |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | [240](../../src/nookku/stdio.py) | The seconds to wait for the agent. |
| `--log PATH` | `app.log` next to the record | Stdio mode: the file for the agent's stderr. |
| `--adapter NAME` | `json` | `json` or `openai` ([SPEC.md section 4.1](../../SPEC.md#adapters)). |
| `--message-field PATH` | `text` | `json` adapter: the field path of the message in the request. |
| `--reply-field PATH` | `reply` | `json` adapter: the field path of the reply in the response. |

Give exactly one of `--agent` and `--cmd`.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The tap stopped, for example after Ctrl-C. |
| 2 | The flags are wrong, for example both `--agent` and `--cmd`. |

## Internal commands

The relays and the bridge run these commands. You do not run them yourself.

### `nookku hook`

The hook command that `init` writes into the hook file. It reads one hook event as JSON on stdin and writes the answer on stdout ([SPEC.md section 5](../../SPEC.md#5-relays)).

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | from the event | The project. With no `--root`, a Claude Code hook takes `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, and each hook then takes the `cwd` of the event, else its working folder. The plugin gives no `--root`. |
| `--harness NAME` | required | `codex` or `claude-code`. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The hook answered. If the hook fails in relay mode, it still blocks the prompt. |
| 2 | A wrong argument, an event that cannot be read, or both the old and the new state folder in the project. Exit 2 blocks the event, so the relay fails closed. |

### `nookku mcp`

The MCP server that gives the model the read-only tools `transcript` and `status`. It reads one JSON-RPC message on each line of stdin and writes each answer on stdout. A harness starts it from its MCP configuration ([SPEC.md section 5](../../SPEC.md#5-relays)). The plugin does not start it yet: [#216](https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku/issues/216) adds it to the plugin.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | the current folder | The project. Claude Code and Codex start the server of the plugin in the project. The server does not read `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, because a Codex can inherit it from a Claude Code session of another project. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | stdin ended. |

### `nookku bridge`

The background process of a test ([architecture.md](../architecture.md#the-bridge)). `start` runs it. `nookku --help` does not show this command.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | required | The project. |
| `--test ID` | required | The test id. |
| `--tester-session ID` | none | The tester's harness session id. |

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The test ended. |
| 1 | The bridge could not start the entry, the entry exited at start, or the bridge could not read the start time of its process. |
