# Test an agent with the project hooks in Claude Code

The project hooks install the [relay](../reference/glossary.md#relay) in one project. `nookku init` writes 2 command hooks that run `nookku hook`, the same command as the plugin. They show each reply as the reason of a blocked prompt, and in `nookku view`, in a second terminal. Use them if you cannot install plugins. To compare them with the plugin, read [choose-a-relay.md](choose-a-relay.md). For Codex, read [codex.md](codex.md).

**Warning:** Do not also enable the plugin in this project. With both forms, each message goes to the agent two times ([choose-a-relay.md](choose-a-relay.md#switch-from-one-form-to-the-other)).

The proofs ran on Claude Code 2.1.295 ([data](../../proofs/hooks-claude-code/results.json)). [getting-started.md](../getting-started.md) shows each step of the project hooks with the toy shop, and the real output of each step.

Before you start, connect a test to your app: [connect-your-agent.md](connect-your-agent.md).

## Install

In your project, write the hooks with the [entry](../reference/glossary.md#entry):

```bash
nookku init claude-code --entry "python3 examples/toy-shop/agent.py"
```

It writes `.nookku/config.json` and adds [2 hooks](../../src/nookku/kit.py) to `.claude/settings.local.json`. It keeps your other hooks. Add `--models claude-code,codex` if your app runs its own model sessions.

## Run a test

1. In a second terminal, start the viewer:

   ```bash
   nookku view
   ```

   It shows each turn of the latest test, and it follows to the next test.

2. Start Claude Code in the project and type the prompt `nookku start`. The relay starts the test and does not send this prompt to the model.
3. Type your test messages. Claude Code shows each reply as the reason of a blocked prompt. The viewer also shows the replies.
4. Type the prompt `nookku end`. The relay ends the test, and the model evaluates it and writes `report.md` (see [Evaluation](#evaluation)).

The prompt `nookku status` shows the running test. You can also start and end a test from a shell: `nookku start` and `nookku end`. The end from a shell starts no evaluation. To evaluate that test later, type the prompt `nookku end`.

`nookku trace` builds the [trace](../reference/glossary.md#trace) of the latest test again and shows its findings.

Each test is a new conversation, with a new test id and a new entry process. The [test folder](../reference/glossary.md#test-folder) is `.nookku/tests/<test-id>/`. [reference/records.md](../reference/records.md#the-test-folder) lists its files.

If a message gets an error, read [troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md#during-a-test).

## What the model can do

The model reads the exact conversation of the latest test with `nookku transcript`. The command prints the exact turns, and the `transcript` tool of the plugin gives the model the same text.

During a test, the model cannot send a message to the agent, and it cannot change the files in `.nookku/`. The relay denies each tool call that writes into `.nookku/`. It also denies each other tool call that names `.nookku`, also a read command such as `cat`. Only the file tools can read these files ([SPEC.md section 5](../../SPEC.md#5-relays)).

During a test, the relay also denies a model command that runs the entry, for example `python3 entry.py`. A command that only reads the entry, for example `cat entry.py`, can run.

## Evaluation

The evaluation prompt ([evaluate.md](../../src/nookku/evaluate.md)) tells the model to:

1. read the transcript with the trace: `nookku transcript --trace`;
2. read `findings.json` and `audit.json`;
3. read your app's code and its business rules;
4. check your app's state with read-only commands;
5. write `report.md`: one row for each issue, with its class, its turn and its evidence.

The model did not see the conversation while you talked, so it judges the record, not its memory. Claude Code asks you to allow each command of the model, unless your permission settings allow it.

After a test, the relay denies model writes to the test folder, except `report.md`. A shell command that names `.nookku` can only read, or write `report.md` ([SPEC.md section 5](../../SPEC.md#5-relays) lists the read programs).

To stop the evaluation, add `"evaluate": false` to `.nookku/config.json`. [evaluation-example.md](../evaluation-example.md) shows a test and its report.

## Audit

```bash
nookku audit --tap .nookku/tests/<test-id>/tap.jsonl --relay .nookku/tests/<test-id>/relay.jsonl
```

Exit code 0 means clean, 1 means a break, and 2 means that a record is missing or invalid ([SPEC.md section 3.4](../../SPEC.md#34-exit-codes)).
