# Upgrade Nookku

This page upgrades the CLI, the package in your app's environment, the Claude Code plugin and the Codex hooks. Some releases need a special step. Read the section of each release from your version to the new version in [Releases with a special step](#releases-with-a-special-step). [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) lists all changes.

The output on this page is the real output of each step. I used the toy shop project of [getting-started.md](../getting-started.md) with verbatim-relay 0.3.0 and Claude Code 2.1.294 on macOS. I shortened the paths of the folders to `.../`. The test id and the times are different on your machine.

## 1. End each running test

End each running test before you upgrade. A new version can read the `current.json` of an old test as no test, and then it does not stop the old bridge (see [0.3.0](#030)).

In each project that uses Nookku, run:

```bash
nookku status
```

If the line names a test, end it:

```bash
nookku end
```

If the line names no test and relay mode is on, follow [recover-a-stuck-test.md](recover-a-stuck-test.md).

## 2. Upgrade the CLI and the package

If you installed the CLI from PyPI, run:

```bash
uv tool upgrade nookku
```

If you installed it from the repo, install it again:

```bash
uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku
```

Check the version:

```bash
nookku --version
```

```text
nookku 0.3.0
```

The hooks of the kit run the Python of the CLI install, for example `.../nookku/bin/python -m nookku hook ...`. Thus the hooks use the new version, and the hook file does not change. If you install the CLI in a new place, run `nookku init` again, so that the hooks name the new Python.

If your entry imports `nookku`, for example to use `serve()`, upgrade the package in your app's environment too ([connect-your-agent.md](connect-your-agent.md#in-python-use-serve)). With uv, run:

```bash
uv sync --upgrade-package nookku
```

If your version constraint excludes the new version, change the constraint first, for example with `uv add --dev "nookku>=0.3"`. Then check the version with the interpreter of the entry:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m nookku --version
```

```text
nookku 0.3.0
```

## 3. Update the plugin

If you use the Claude Code plugin, update the marketplace and the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update nookku
claude plugin update nookku@nookku
```

The second command names the new version, or says that the plugin is already at the latest version. Restart Claude Code to load the new version. `claude plugin list` shows the version of `nookku@nookku`.

Each hook of the plugin, its MCP server and `/nookku` run the `nookku` command from `PATH`. Upgrade the CLI and the plugin to the same version. The plugin has no options: it reads `config.json`. If you set plugin options before 0.4.0, set the same keys with `nookku init plugin` ([reference/cli.md](../reference/cli.md#nookku-init)).

## 4. Trust the Codex hooks again

If you use Codex, with the plugin or with the project hooks, start `codex` in the project. Type `/hooks`, check the 2 nookku hooks and trust them.

Do not skip this step. If Codex does not trust the hooks, it does not run them, and the model answers your test messages. `nookku start` refuses a test until you trust them ([SPEC.md section 7.8](../../SPEC.md#78-codex-hook-gate)) ([troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md#in-codex-the-model-answers-my-test-messages)). You must trust a hook again after each change to it, for example after a new `nookku init` or a new plugin version ([codex.md](codex.md#install)).

## 5. Run `check`

```bash
nookku check
```

```text
Test 20261007-224410-2171: .../toy-shop/.nookku/tests/20261007-224410-2171
Reply: Which item is this about: the mug or the teapot?
Audit: exit 0
PASS
```

`check` runs a short test with one message through the new version, and exits with 0 if it passes ([reference/cli.md](../reference/cli.md#nookku-check)). If it fails, each FAIL line gives the cause and the fix ([troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md#end-a-test)).

## Releases with a special step

### 0.4.0

verbatim-relay is now Nookku ([#181](https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku/issues/181)). The package, the CLI, the module and the plugin have new names, so the steps 2 and 3 above do not apply. Do these steps in their place.

1. End each running test with the old CLI:

   ```bash
   verbatim-relay end
   ```

2. Remove the old CLI and install the new CLI:

   ```bash
   uv tool uninstall verbatim-relay
   uv tool install nookku
   ```

3. In each project, run one `nookku` command, for example `nookku status`. The command moves `.verbatim-relay/` to `.nookku/`, with each test and each seal, and prints the 2 folders. If `config.json` has a `record` path in `.verbatim-relay/`, the command changes it to the same file in `.nookku/`.

4. If `.verbatim-relay/` and `.nookku/` both exist, each command stops with exit 1 and names the 2 folders. Each hook event is blocked. Keep one folder: move the tests that you need into `.nookku/tests/`, then remove `.verbatim-relay/`.

5. If you use the project hooks (the hook kit of 0.3), run `nookku init` again with the same harness and flags. It replaces the hooks that verbatim-relay wrote. In Codex, trust the hooks again (step 4 above).

6. If you use the Claude Code plugin, remove the old plugin and its marketplace, then install the new plugin:

   ```bash
   claude plugin uninstall verbatim-relay@verbatim-relay
   claude plugin marketplace remove verbatim-relay
   claude plugin marketplace add mohanraj00/nookku
   claude plugin install nookku@nookku
   ```

   Then run `nookku init plugin` one time in each project. The plugin has no options now, so it reads each key from `.nookku/config.json`, and in a project with no config file, `/nookku start` keeps relay mode off. `init` keeps each key of an existing file. If you set plugin options before, give the same keys as flags ([reference/cli.md](../reference/cli.md#nookku-init)).

   The plugin now also works in Codex ([codex.md](codex.md#install)). If you used the project hooks in Codex, you can change to the plugin ([choose-a-relay.md](choose-a-relay.md#from-the-project-hooks-to-the-plugin)).

7. If your entry imports the package, change `verbatim_relay` to `nookku` in the import, for example `from nookku.agent import serve`. Then change the package in your app's environment:

   ```bash
   uv remove --dev verbatim-relay
   uv add --dev nookku
   ```

8. If you set `VERBATIM_RELAY_HOME`, set `NOOKKU_HOME` in its place. `verify` still reads the seal copies of old tests from `~/.verbatim-relay/seals/`, or from `VERBATIM_RELAY_HOME` if it is set.

Then run `check` (step 5 above).

### 0.3.0

**A test that 0.2.0 started.** `current.json` now needs `pid_start`, the start time of the bridge ([#44](https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku/issues/44)). 0.3.0 treats a test that 0.2.0 started as not running. `status` names no test, and `end` removes `current.json` but sends no signal to the old bridge. The old bridge and its entry continue to run.

I made this state with 0.3.0: I started a test and removed `pid_start` from its `current.json`. Then `status` and `end` printed:

```text
relay mode is on.
```

```text
No test runs. Relay mode is off.
```

Find the old bridge:

```bash
ps -A -o pid=,command= | grep '[v]erbatim_relay bridge'
```

```text
38282 .../bin/python -m verbatim_relay bridge --root .../toy-shop --test 20261007-224554-4b17
```

Stop it with SIGTERM, the default signal of `kill`:

```bash
kill 38282
```

On SIGTERM, the bridge ends the test as `end` does: it stops the entry, and writes the trace, the audit and the seal. The bridge of 0.2.0 does the same ([bridge.py of 0.2.0](https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku/blob/v0.2.0/src/verbatim_relay/bridge.py#L514)). In my run, the test folder then had `audit.json` and `seal.json`:

```bash
nookku verify 20261007-224554-4b17
```

```text
Seal: intact. No record changed after the end of the test.
```

Do not use `kill -9` on the bridge. With SIGKILL, the bridge cannot write the audit and the seal ([recover-a-stuck-test.md](recover-a-stuck-test.md#4-learn-what-a-stale-currentjson-is)).

**Unknown keys in `config.json`.** `start`, `check` and `init` now stop at an unknown key, for example a key with a typo ([#89](https://github.com/mohanraj00/nookku/issues/89)). Before, `start` accepted it. With the key `evaluation` in place of `evaluate`, `check` printed this text and exited with 1:

```text
nookku: .nookku/config.json has unknown keys: ['evaluation']. Correct or remove them.
```

Correct the name of the key, or remove it. [reference/config.md](../reference/config.md) lists each key.
